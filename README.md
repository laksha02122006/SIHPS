## Problem Title 


SpeedSnap – Network Health Logger
## Problem Description
An app that automatically logs internet speed at regular intervals, analyzes the data, and generates comprehensive performance reports. Users can view trends over time, detect connectivity issues, and receive alerts when speeds drop below expected levels. The app also supports exporting reports and allows users to share their internet quality status with service providers for better troubleshooting.

## Idea
1. Automated Internet Speed Logging:
Records internet speed (download, upload, latency) at set intervals using background services.

2. Report Generation and Sharing:
Summarizes performance metrics in downloadable reports. Includes charts, trends, and comparisons.

3. Real-Time Alerts & Notifications:
Sends alerts when the speed falls below a certain threshold or when there's a network outage.

4. Data Visualization Dashboard:
Provides users with a clean, interactive dashboard showing historical data, average speeds, peak times, etc.

5. Privacy-First User Data Storage:
Ensures secure storage of speed logs with strict adherence to data privacy policies.

6. Virtual Support Assistant:
Offers solutions for speed issues, basic troubleshooting steps, and connectivity tips via AI chat.
